This Python package provides comprehensive tools for analyzing simply supported beams subjected to point loads and uniformly distributed loads. It computes shear force and bending moment diagrams, calculates maximum deflections, and visualizes results with publication-quality plots suitable for civil and structural engineering research and education.

## Features
- Support for multiple point loads and uniform distributed loads.
- Calculation and visualization of shear force and bending moment diagrams.
- Maximum deflection computation.
- Export graphics as PNG and PDF.
- Example usage scripts and test data for reproducibility.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run examples with `python main.py`.
